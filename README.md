This is a prototype that utilizes the MongoDB database and Node.JS environment to create an API.  The API contains songs with 
user comments, profiles, artist profiles etc.  The API is RESTful and supports all CRUD operations.

The reason for this prototype is to explore building an API for either the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) or MERN 
(MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) web application stacks.  I will be using one of these stacks for my personal website 
and blog `jarombek.com`.

You will notice that both MEAN and MERN stacks contain both MongoDB and Node.js, so this prototype will help me when I build 
the full website.

There will be a blog post for this prototype here:
